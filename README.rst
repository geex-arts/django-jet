Installation
============

* Download and install latest version of Django JET:

.. code:: python

    pip install django-jet
    # or
    easy_install django-jet

* Add 'jet' application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your Django project settings.py file (note it should be before 'django.contrib.admin'):

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'jet',
        'django.contrib.admin',
    )
        
* Make sure 'django.core.context_processors.request' context processor is enabled in settings.py:

.. code:: python
        
    from django.conf import global_settings
    
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS + (
        'django.core.context_processors.request',
    )

* Add URL-pattern to the urlpatterns of your Django project urls.py file (they are needed for related–lookups and autocompletes):

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^jet/', include('jet.urls', 'jet')),  # Django JET URLS
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        ...
    )

* Create database tables:

.. code:: python

    python manage.py migrate jet
    # or 
    python manage.py syncdb
        
* Collect static if you are in production environment:

.. code:: python

        python manage.py collectstatic
        
* Clear your browser cache

Dashboard installation
======================

.. note:: Dashboard is located into a separate application. So after a typical JET installation it won't be active.
          To enable dashboard application follow these steps:

* Add 'jet.dashboard' application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your Django project settings.py file (note it should be before 'jet'):

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'jet.dashboard',
        'jet',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        ...
    )

* Add URL-pattern to the urlpatterns of your Django project urls.py file (they are needed for related–lookups and autocompletes):

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^jet/', include('jet.urls', 'jet')),  # Django JET URLS
        url(r'^jet/dashboard/', include('jet.dashboard.urls', 'jet-dashboard')),  # Django JET dashboard URLS
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        ...
    )

* **For Google Analytics widgets only** install python package:

.. code::

    pip install google-api-python-client

* Create database tables:

.. code:: python

    python manage.py migrate dashboard
    # or
    python manage.py syncdb
